      <p><strong>Review:</strong> The kaiseki meal was amazing and featured 10 courses. 
      Every course was beautifully and artistically prepared using different seasonal 
      ingredients. The service was some of the best service we've ever had. The restaurant's 
      staff was <em>amazing</em>. The restaurant was booked for the evening, but they managed 
      to squeeze us in. And, we ended up in a private dining room.</p>
