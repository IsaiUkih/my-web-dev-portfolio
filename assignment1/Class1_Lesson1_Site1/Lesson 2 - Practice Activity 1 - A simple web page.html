  <h1>Help Me Pay My Tuition: Selling My Prized Comic Book Collection</h1>

  <h2>Why I'm Letting Go</h2>
  <p>
    It breaks my heart, but <strong>college tuition isn't going to pay itself</strong>. After years of collecting rare and vintage comic books, I’ve decided to sell my entire collection to cover my upcoming semester at Penn State. These comics have brought me endless joy, but now it’s time for them to bring me a brighter future.
  </p>
  <p>
    My collection includes original issues from the <em>Silver Age</em> of comics, limited editions, and mint-condition superhero classics. Whether you're a seasoned collector or just getting started, this is a golden opportunity to own a piece of comic history. Every issue has been stored with care, kept in <em>climate-controlled</em> sleeves to ensure perfect preservation.
  </p>

  <h2>Featured Comic: Amazing Fantasy #15</h2>
  <p>
    Among the highlights is a 1962 copy of <strong><em>Amazing Fantasy #15</em></strong>—the first appearance of Spider-Man! This iconic issue is a centerpiece of any serious collection and is in <em>excellent</em> condition.
