1. Write a JavaScript program that uses two for loops:

The first loop computes the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and then outputs the result to the console window.
The second loop computes the product of all odd numbers between 1 and 10 (inclusive) and then outputs the result to the console window.

      // let productOddNumbers = 1;

      // for(let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
      //   if ((i % 2) ===0) {
      //     sumEvenIntegers +=i;
      //   }
      // } 
      // console.log("Sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100: " + sumEvenIntegers);

2. Write a JavaScript program that uses a while loop:

The loop computes the sum of all numbers entered by the user until the user enters 0.  Consider 0 as the sentinel value, which indicates the user desires to conclude the program.
Once the loop concludes (i.e. the sentinel was provided), output the result to the console window.

     console.log("Sum of all numbers entered: " + sumOfNumbers.toFixed(2));
